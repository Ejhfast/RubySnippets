# Title: Packing an array
# Category: [ Standard lib ]
#
# Description: TODO - details of pack
# Packs the array into a binary sequence using template string str1, and then
# removes occurances of characters of str2 from the sequence string. The array
# is constructed by interpolating var0, str0 and var1 into a string, and then
# wrapping the string with an array
#
# Useful programming task or idiom: [ Yes ]
# Can be encapsulated in standalone function: [ Yes ]
# There's a more common way to write the code snippet: [ No ]

# Title: raise ArgumentError conditionally

#
# Useful programming task or idiom: [ Yes ]
# Can be encapsulated in standalone function: [ Yes ]
